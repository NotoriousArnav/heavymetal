[00:01.77] (Ah, ah, ah-ah-ah-ah-ah)
[00:06.31] (Ah-ah, ah-ah-ah-ah-ah)
[00:09.65] (Ah, ah, ah-ah-ah-ah-ah)
[00:14.68] (Ah-ah, ah-ah-ah-ah-ah)
[00:18.33] I was listenin' to the ocean
[00:22.09] I saw a face in the sand
[00:25.35] But when I picked it up
[00:27.66] Then it vanished away from my hands, dah
[00:34.51] I had a dream, I was seven
[00:38.38] Climbin' my way in a tree
[00:42.07] I saw a piece of Heaven
[00:45.09] Waitin' in patience for me, dah
[00:50.91] And I was runnin' far away
[00:53.20] Would I run off the world someday?
[00:55.82] Nobody knows, nobody knows
[00:59.79] And I was dancing in the rain
[01:01.66] I felt alive and I can't complain
[01:03.92] But no, take me home
[01:06.13] Take me home where I belong
[01:10.56] I can't take it anymore
[01:16.51] I was painting a picture
[01:20.51] The picture was a painting of you
[01:22.94] And for a moment I thought you were here
[01:27.30] But then again, it wasn't true, dah
[01:32.84] And all this time I have been lyin'
[01:36.42] Oh, lyin' in secret to myself
[01:40.77] I've been putting sorrow on the farthest place on my shelf
[01:46.31] La-di-da
[01:49.43] And I was runnin' far away
[01:51.52] Would I run off the world someday?
[01:54.33] Nobody knows, nobody knows
[01:58.11] And I was dancing in the rain
[01:59.94] I felt alive and I can't complain
[02:02.48] But no, take me home
[02:04.60] Take me home where I belong
[02:08.18] I got no other place to go
[02:10.88] No, take me home
[02:12.75] Take me home where I belong
[02:16.34] I got no other place to go
[02:18.89] No, take me home
[02:21.14] Take me home where I belong
[02:25.41] I can't take it anymore
[02:30.99] But I kept runnin' for a soft place to fall
[02:39.05] And I kept runnin' for a soft place to fall
[02:47.82] And I kept runnin' for a soft place to fall
[02:55.62] And I kept runnin' for a soft place to fall
[03:04.54] And I was runnin' far away
[03:06.78] Would I run off the world someday?
[03:09.24] But no, take me home
[03:11.38] Take me home where I belong
[03:14.94] I got no other place to go
[03:17.54] No, take me home
[03:19.59] Take me home where I belong
[03:23.29] I got no other place to go
[03:26.35] No, take me home, home where I belong, no, no
[03:34.54] No, take me home, home where I belong, oh, oh, oh
[03:43.11] No, take me home, home where I belong, no, no
[03:51.23] No, take me home, home where I belong
[03:57.16] I can't take it anymore
[04:02.03]
